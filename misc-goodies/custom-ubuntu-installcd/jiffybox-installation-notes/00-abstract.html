        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        
This is a documentation of what and how I installed and configured on THIS Virtual Server instance (<a href="https://www.jiffybox.de/">jiffybox</a>), starting from a
fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.04 (amd64 Server).<br/>
The article describes, among other things, how to set up web-, app-, and a SQL servers, a content management system and a Maven repository.<br/>
This guide refers to THIS Jiffybox server, but tries to be as general as possible, to serve as a reference work for future software installations and configurations.<br/>
Before I performed this procedure on the Jiffybox instance, I've tested it on a bare Ubuntu 10.04 (x86 server) installation inside a VirtualBox VM. Thus, each step was done successfully on 2 different systems.
