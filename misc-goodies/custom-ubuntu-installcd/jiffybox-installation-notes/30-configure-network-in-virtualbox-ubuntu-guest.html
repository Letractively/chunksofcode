<h2>How to set up a network connection between the guest and the host</h2>

<p>
    This will show how to connect to your VirtualBox VM via network without
    changing your host computer's network settings like setting up a LAN
    or change your firewall configuration.<br/>
    Therefore we will use a host-only-adapter as a virtual network visible
    only for the guest and the host.
</p>
<p>
    In this example I am using one virtual
    network card using NAT, for the guest's internet access and a second
    card using host-only to interact with the host computer inside a secure, 
    isolated network environment.<br/>
    The guest system and the host are both Ubuntu 12.04 LTS instances.
</p>


<h3>Host Configuration</h3>
<p>
    First, add a new "Host-only Network adapter" in your virtualbox UI:
    Follow File-&lt;Preferences-&lt;Network and make sure there is an
    adapter definition vboxnet0 with enabled DHCP. If not, create one.
</p>
<p>
    You need to shut down the guest machine before you are allowed to
    change its settings.<br/>
    Then go to your machine item and enable a second network Adapter
    with "Host-only" mode.<br/>
    That's it for the host side.
</p>

<h3>Guest Configuration</h3>

Important config files
<ul><li>/etc/network/interfaces</li></ul>

<p>
    After starting the machine, we need to configure the guest's network
    to use the new network adapter. Edit the <b>/etc/network/interfaces</b><br/>
    Add/edit the eth1 entry:
    <pre>auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Then restart the network service:
    <pre>root@guestbox # /etc/init.d/networking restart</pre>

    and check if eth1 is listed at your ifconfig output:
    <pre>root@guestbox # ifconfig</pre>
    Okay, done with the guest configuration.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Start play around</h3>

The IP address listed at ifconfig at eth1 on the guest is now reachable
on the host machine and the IP of the host is listed at the vboxnet0 adapter
in the hosts ifconfig output, if you want to connect from the guest to the
host.<br/>
</p>

<p>
<pre>                         # IP of guests eth1 ifconfig
andre@buenosaires ~ % ssh tester @192.168.56.101 
tester @192.168.56.101's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</pre>
<pre>                         # IP of hosts vboxnet0 ifconfig
tester@guestbox $ ssh andre @192.168.56.1  
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</pre>
<p>
    For maximum comfort, you can name the IP address in your /etc/hosts:
    <pre>andre@buenosaires ~ % cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       buenosaires     localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.56.102  vbox-worker-1
andre@buenosaires ~ % ssh tester @vbox-worker-1
tester @192.168.56.101's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic-pae i686)</pre>
</p>
